#  Building a Representative Genome Tree of Insects
Insects dominate life on Earth in both abundance and diversity, yet our understanding of their evolutionary history remains surprisingly incomplete. Advances in genome sequencing are transforming the life sciences, but applying these technologies to insects poses a fundamental challenge: how do we study a group that is not only hyperdiverse, but also profoundly underdescribed?
For decades, global insect diversity was estimated at around 5.5 million species, with only one in five formally described. Recent large-scale inventories using DNA metabarcoding now suggest that true insect diversity likely far greater - likely reaching tens of millions. These discoveries reveal that our knowledge of the insect tree of life is far more fragmented and biased than previously assumed. Ironically, current genome sequencing efforts often reinforce these biases by focusing on well-known, easily sampled lineages—leaving vast regions of insect diversity genomically unexplored.
The DarkTree project aims to close these gaps by building a more representative insect genome tree. We will leverage the unique global insect collections generated by the Insect Biome Atlas [https://www.insectbiomeatlas.org/] and LIFEPLAN [https://www.slu.se/en/research/research-catalogue/projekt/l/lifeplan/] projects: over 20,000 samples comprising approximately 30 million insects and representing around one million species. Crucially, the species composition of each sample has already been characterized using DNA metabarcoding. This allows us to bypass traditional taxonomic bottlenecks and systematically select genomes in a way that reflects real insect diversity.
To achieve this, we will develop and integrate innovative methods across the entire workflow. These include machine-learning approaches for visual detection and identification of target specimens, as well as probabilistic frameworks for combining genomic and metabarcoding data and inferring evolutionary trees at unprecedented scales.

Beyond fundamental evolutionary biology, the project will establish a new foundation for monitoring and assessing global insect biomes. By advancing automated species identification and improving the accuracy of biodiversity assessments using environmental DNA, our work will directly support more reliable reporting of biodiversity change in a rapidly transforming world.
Together, these efforts will reshape how we study insect evolution, moving from a biased and fragmented picture toward a comprehensive, data-driven understanding of the most diverse animal group on the planet.
